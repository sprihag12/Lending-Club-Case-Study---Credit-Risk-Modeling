The case study was a part of the Machine Learning for Problem Solving graduate-level course (95-828) at Carnegie Mellon University. It was divided into 3 phases:
Phase 1: Intended to understand the motivation behind the problem statement, working on P2P lending, and data overview.
Phase 2: Intended to perform a preliminary analysis of data including cleaning, preparation, and exploration. 
Phase 3: Intended to employ predictive analytics to predict how likely a loan is to default.
